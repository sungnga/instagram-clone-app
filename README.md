## BUILDING ACCOUNTS PAGES

### 2. Creating routes for our pages:
- In src/App.js file
  - Import: `import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route } from 'react-router-dom';`
  - We begin by creating the individual routes that we've laid out. We're using the package react-router-dom to create the individual routes
  - There are a total of 8 routes

### 3. Building the shared Layout and Navbar components:
- We start by building out the Layout component. The Layout is going to provide the basic structure to a great deal of pages in our application
- For example, it's going to allow us to easily inject the Navbar component to many pages
- In src/components/shared/Layout.js file:
  - This component accepts the children props and we can destructure that
  - The styles written in this component is going to apply to all of its children components
  - This Layout component renders the SEO and Navbar components
- In src/components/shared/Seo.js file:
  - Import Helmet: `import Helmet from 'react-helmet';`
  - Use Helmet just like a regular react component. And we can add any meta data we want between the Helmet tags
  - We want to display the name of the page as meta information inside the browser tab
- In src/components/shared/Navbar.js file:
  - Import: `import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';`
  - Use the Link component from react-router-dom to add a link to another page
  - The Navbar component renders the Instagram logo
  - When clicking on the IG logo, it'll take you to the homepage, which is the FeedPage

### 4. Building the NotFoundPage component:
- This is the default page when a route a user is try to visit doesn't match one of the routes we defined 
- This page renders to Layout component to create the page layout and add styling
- It has a simple Navbar header with the Instagram logo and a page-not-found message to the user with a link that takes them back to homepage
